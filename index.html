    <!---I think my main problem is not understanding and defining my divs and other tags with proper classes and then calling them up properly. I will work on this and fix it, Brian helped me understand it a little bit with the bootstrap lesson tonight.-->

            <p>Brendan has been a technology hobbyist for 15 years, but is new to professional web development. Over the last 15 years he has held many jobs in the Hospitality Industry, though his true passion in foodservice is behind the bar. From a young age Brendan has enjoyed creating things. This started in stage performance, as an actor, set builder, and lighting designer. He attended college for Technical Theatre with an emphasis on scenic and lighting design. After only a year in college he decided it was time to join the work force to gain some real world perspective. He began to work at a world renowned cigar bar and it was then that he discovered his love of Hospitality. He spent the next 12 years learning everything he could about wine, beer, craft cocktails, food, cigars and the art of service. </p>
